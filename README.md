On your Pi, edit the file /etc/rc.local using the editor of your choice. You must edit it with root permissions:

```
sudo vim /etc/rc.local
```


Add commands to execute the python program, preferably using absolute referencing of the file location (complete file path are preferred).
Be sure to leave the line exit 0 at the end, then save the file and exit. In nano, to exit, type Ctrl-x, and then Y.
