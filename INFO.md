### Global Navigation Satellite Systems



I use the [L76X Multi-GNSS Module](https://www.waveshare.com/l76x-gps-module.htm). It is a general Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) module which supports Global Positioning System (GPS), BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) and Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS). All of these different systems use satellite navigation to provide geo-spatial positioning. It allows small electronic receivers to determine theri location (longitude, latitude and altitude/elevation) using time signals transmitted along a line of sight by radio from satellites [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_navigation]

As of October 2018, the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) GPS and [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia)'s [GLONASS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLONASS) are fully operational GNSSs, with [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China)'s BDS and the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union)'s [Galileo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_(satellite_navigation)) scheduled to be fully operational by 2020.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_navigation#cite_note-autogenerated1-1)[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_navigation#cite_note-autogenerated2-2) Japan's QZSS is a GPS [satellite-based augmentation system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNSS_augmentation#Satellite-based_augmentation_system) to enhance GPS's accuracy, with satellite navigation independent of GPS scheduled for 2023.

GPS, originally Navstar GPS, is the most popular satellite navigation system for military and civilian use, and as the name suggests, operates globally. It is owned by the United States government and operated by the U.S. Air Force Space Command (AFSPC). Its first launch was in February 1978. As of October 18, 2018, there were a total of 31 operational satellites in the GPS constellation. [https://www.yugatech.com/guides/gps-glonass-bds-qzss-gnss-irnss-what-are-they/]

The Chinese BDS was first launched on October 30, 2000 with three satellites and served mostly users in China and neighboring regions. China decommissioned Beidou-1 at the end of 2012 and moved on to Beidou-2 with ten satellites in orbit. In 2015, China launched the Beidou-3 with 23 satellites in orbit with the intention to provide global coverage in 2020 with a constellation of 35 satellites.

The Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) is a project of the Japanese government and operated by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), with an aim to be a satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS) 
for the U.S. GPS to be receivable in the Asia-Oceania regions, with a focus on Japan. The first Quasi-Zenith Satellite (QZS-1) launched on September 11, 2010. In 2017, the Japanese government launched three more
on separate occasions, the QZS-2, QZS-3, and QZS-4, bringing the total to four. Japan intends to bring the total number up to seven after 2018  [https://www.yugatech.com/guides/gps-glonass-bds-qzss-gnss-irnss-what-are-they/]

### Understanding the information from the GPS receiver

The satellite data is sent with the NMEA 0183 protocol. NMEA stands for the National Marine Electronics Association which has developed a standard for communication between [marine electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_electronics) such as [echo sounder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_sounder), [sonars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonar), [anemometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemometer), [gyrocompass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrocompass), [autopilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-steering_gear), [GPS receivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_receiver) and many other types of instruments. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_0183]



The NMEA format includes the complete PVT (position, velocity, time) information computed by the GPS receiver. The idea of NMEA is to send a line of data called a sentence that is totally self contained and independent from other sentences.

Each sentence begins with a '$' and ends with a carriage return/line feed sequence and can be no longer than 80 characters of visible text (plus the line terminators). The data is contained within this single line with data items separated by commas.

All of the standard sentences have a two letter prefix that defines the device that uses that sentence type.
For gps receivers the prefix is GP. GN means that a combination of navigation systems was used to obtain the message data. which is followed by a three letter sequence that defines the sentence contents.  In addition NMEA permits hardware manufactures to define their own proprietary sentences for whatever purpose they see fit.  All proprietary sentences begin with the letter P and are followed with 3 letters that identifies the manufacturer controlling that sentence.  For example a Garmin sentence would start with PGRM and Magellan would begin with PMGN.



* GSA - Overall Satellite data
* GSV - Detailed Satellite data

* GST - GPS Pseudorange Noise Statistics



* GLL - Lat/Lon data
* ZDA - Date and Time
* GGA - Fix information
* VTG - Vector track an Speed over the Ground
* RMX - recommended minimum data for gps

### GPS formats

#### Longitude and Latitude

Lines of latitude are horizontal lines that stretch from east to west  across the globe. The longest and main line of latitude is called the  Equator. The Equator is represented as 0° latitude.

![](/home/natalie/Pictures/Selection_088.png)

Moving  north of the Equator, each line of latitude increases by 1°. Therefore,  there will be lines of latitude representing 1°, 2°, 3°, and so on up  to 90°. The 90°  line of latitude is represented by a dot at the North Pole. All  lines of latitude above the Equator are indicated with the letter ‘N’ to  denote north of the Equator.

Moving south of the Equator, each line of latitude  increases by 1° as well. All lines of  latitude below the Equator is indicated with the letter ‘S’ to denote  south of the Equator. The 90° line of  latitude is represented by a dot at the South Pole.



##### Longitude

Lines of longitude are vertical lines that stretch from the North Pole  to the South Pole. The main line of longitude is called the Prime  Meridian. The Prime Meridian is represented as 0° longitude.

![](/home/natalie/Pictures/Selection_087.png)

Moving  east of the Prime Meridian, each line of latitude increases by 1°.  Therefore, there will be lines of longitude representing 1°, 2°, 3°, and  so on up to 180°. 
All lines  of longitude east of the Prime Meridian are indicated with the letter  ‘E’ to denote east of the Prime Meridian. All lines of longitude west of the Prime Meridian  are indicated with the letter ‘W’ to denote west of the Prime Meridian. 



##### Reading Geographical Coordinates

When outlining the coordinates of a location, the line of latitude is always given first followed by the line of longitude.

However, most locations on the Earth do not fall along the lines of  latitude or longitude, but within the shapes created from the  intersection of the horizontal and vertical lines. In order to  accurately pinpoint a human being on the Earth’s surface, the lines of  latitude and longitude are further divided and expressed in one of the  three common formats:

**(1) Degrees, minutes, and seconds (DMS)**

The  space between each line of latitude or longitude representing 1° is  divided into 60 minutes, and each minute is divided into 60 seconds. An  example of this format is:

**41°24’12.2″N   2°10’26.5″E**

The line of latitude is read as 41 degrees (41°), 24 minutes (24′),  12.2 seconds (12.2”) north. The line of longitude is read as 2 degrees  (2°), 10 minutes (10′), 26.5 seconds (12.2”) east.

**(2) Degrees and decimal minutes (DMM)**

The  space between each line of latitude or longitude representing 1° is  divided into 60 minutes, and each minute is further divided and  expressed as decimals. An example of this format is:

**41 24.2028,  2 10.4418**

The  line of latitude is read as 41 degrees (41), 24.2028 minutes (24.2028)  north. The coordinate for the line of latitude represents north of the  Equator because it is positive. If the number is negative, it represents  south of the Equator.45.12345

The line of longitude is read as 2 degrees  (2), 10.4418 minutes (10.4418) east. The coordinate for the line of  longitude represents east of the Prime Meridian because it is positive.  If the number is negative, it represents west of the Prime Meridian.

**(3) Decimal degrees (DD)**

The  space between each line of latitude or longitude representing 1° is  divided and expressed as decimals. An example of this format is:

**41.40338,  2.17403**

The  line of latitude is read as 41.40338 degrees north. The coordinate for  the line of latitude represents north of the Equator because it is  positive. If the number is negative, it represents south of the Equator.

The  line of longitude is read as 2.17403 degrees east. The coordinate for  the line of longitude represents east of the Prime Meridian because it  is positive. If the number is negative, it represents west of the Prime  Meridian.

#### Conversion

The L76X returns the location in the DMM format. To compare the location with the data modules we convert it into the DD format. The following equation is used:
